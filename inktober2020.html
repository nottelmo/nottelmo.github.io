			<h2>About</h2>
			<article>
				<p>Inktober is an annual personal challenge, first introduced by
				Jake Parker in 2009 as a way <em><q cite="https://inktober.com/">to improve his inking skills and
				develop positive drawing habits</em>, by drawing every day in the
				month of October, following a topic each day.
				<p>I decided to take this year's challenge and connect it with
				capoeira.</p>

					<p>When doing some kind of movement, sometimes we forget to
					breath, and the movement becomes stiff. We tremble and shake in
					our boots trying to get a hold of ourselves. A simple trick
					that sometimes help is to close our eyes and remember to
					breath.</p>

				<h3>02 | Mindless</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-02.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira has a term named "dendê". It has different
					interpretation according to different people. In my
					interpretation, it refers heightened state of focus,
					entering in fluid state of mind, body and spirit, allowing
					smooth and free movement within one's capabilities.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>In capoeira, as well as other martial arts, controlling
					the space is essential. During a Roda, the one who controls
					the center, controls the game. The one in the center has
					more space to play with than the one who is near the edges.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira was not always legal. After slavery was
					abolished in 1888, it was criminalized by the goverment
					under the pretense that it served "as a tool that enabled
					slaves to commit offences and criminal acts against their
					masters.". This mindset led the masses to believe capoeira
					practioners (which were mostly composed of brazillian
					natives and were street thugs and "cold-blooded
					murderes".</p>

					<p>When Mestre Bimba created the Capoeira Regional style and
					presented it to the governor in 1930, capoeira became legal
					again.</p>
					</figcaption>

				<h3>05 | Blade</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-05.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Traditionally taught in capoeira, is also Maculêlê. It's
					a dance that can be done with either "facão" (the blade
					slaves used to cut the plantation) or sticks, in both
					hands.</p>

					<p>This dance is usually accompanied by "congas" and/or
					"atabaques", and can be danced with a partner and in
					group.</p>

					<p>While dancing with a partner, both clash each other's
					swords on every 3rd beat on a four scale, and on the forth
					beat they clash their own swords. </p>

					<p>The other 2 beats are free for the player to do what they
					want, be it dancing or doing some acrobatics or clashing
					their swords on the ground</p>

					<p>The origin of this dance is not defined, but there are
					theories. The one I liked most so far is the one of a young
					boy that managed to protect his village from invaders, and
					the people created this dance in his honour and
					memory.</p>

					<p>Check <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NN5I-rOFfo">this</a>
					youtube video to this dance in action</p>

				<h3>06 | Rodent</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-06.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Slaves' living conditions were reliant on the wealth and
					mood of their owner. Conditions were poor and unsanitary and
					finding a mouse or two probably wouldn't come as surprise,
					but it very likely built stress to those in the house.</p>

					<p>Capoeira during slavery besides its cultural use, it also served, for slaves, as
					tool to blow stress away.</p>
				</figcaption>

				<h3>07 | Fancy</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-07.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira is an art form where you use your body to
					express yourself. It's usually stressed during classes that
					moves should look good. Make it a show. Be attractive to the
					eye.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>08 | Teeth</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-08.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>There are several types of games/rhythms in capoeira. One
					game in particular is called "Santa Maria". </p>
					<p>The "Santa Maria" game is traditionally played with a
					reward (usually from the public) wrapped inside a rug or a
					player's t-shirt and this becomes a prize for the first
					player that grabs it with his/her mouth while playing
					Capoeira with the other.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>09 | Throw</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-09.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Throws do exist in Capoeira, despite being very rare
					during a capoeira game. Personally I have never seen one in
					roda, but would love to :D</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>10 | Hope</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-10.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>At the start of a capoeira roda, 2 players gather at the
					berimbau crouched. Here, they can gather their focus and
					pray for a good game.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>11 | Disgusting</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-11.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>It is commonly frowned upon the use of violence in
					capoeira games. A nice game of capoeira is based on playing
					with the other rather than against.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>12 | Slippery</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-12.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira allows the use of "rasteiras" (sweeps). They
					require timing and some skill, but they don't necessarily
					have to be followed through and break the game flow. It can
					just be marked (or placed) to let the partner know that "you
					got him" (or not), which allows the game to continue nice
					and smooth. In the illustration below, the capoeirista being
					"marked" is ready be swept and jump to his back, saving
					himself from a potential rasteira.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

				<h3>13 | Dunes</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-13.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>While researching for this topic, I learned that
					travelling across deserts are usually used for metaphors of
					spiritual searching. </p>
					<p>Some capoeristas talk about the spirituality in capoeira,
					and that it happens inside the roda. When you are inside the
					roda, your core values, and the posture you take on life is
					revealed.</p>
					<p>As a matter of interest, capoeira is not a religion, but
					due to its history and roots, it has a vague connection to
					Candomblé, which I will talk more about in later posts.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>14 | Armor</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-14.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>There is a term in Capoeira called "Corpo Fechado".
					Besides refering to how well you defend yourself in a roda,
					there is a also a legend behind it that is also connected to
					Candomblé, an afro-brazillian religious practice.</p>
					<p>In capoeira history, a legendary capoeira Mestre known as
					Besouro was known for his "Corpo Fechado" and was immune to
					bullets and knifes. It's said that this spell can be
					achieved through certain Candomblé rituals and amulets, and
					can only be broken by a wooden dagger made out of the
					Tucum-tree.</p>
					<p>There is a movie called "Besouro - The Assailant" that
					presents capoeira and uses Mestre Besouro as a protagonist.
					Have a look and enjoy</p>

				<h3>15 | Outpost</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-15.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Slaves that were able to run away from their masters
					would often create or join "Quilombos": Autonomous
					communities, hidden from the public eye, consisting of
					run-away slaves and others persecuted by authorities. </p>
					<p>The most famous "Quilombo" was called "Quilombo de
					Palmares", hosted around 30 thounsand people and lasted for
					almost a century under the great leadership of King Zumbi
					and Queen Dandara.</p>
					<p>Needless to say, Capoeira was used by these communities
					to fight the oppressors</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>16 | Rocket</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-16.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira is also about "Rock et Roll" (Bad pun
					intended).</p>
					<p>There is no capoeira without the "bateria" (band). Only
					techniques being thrown around.</p>
					<p>The beat played decides the pace and style of the game.
					</p>
					<p>In a full "bateria", aka the musical instruments, you
					will find the following (but not limited to)
					instruments:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Berimbau (viola, media & gunga</li>
						<li>Atabaques</li>
						<li>Pandeiros</li>
						<li>Agôgôs</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sometimes, the main singer (usually high ranked
					capoeiristas) also give suggestions to the participants in
					their lyrics as to how they should play or what they should
					be paying attention to, which makes active listening also
					part of playing inside a roda.</p>
					<p>Due to physical limitions, interest or any other reaon,
					some people only play capoeira music without playing inside
					the roda, but this is not to say that they are not
					capoeiristas! Movement inside the roda is only part of what
					capoeira really is!</p>

				<h3>17 | Storm</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-17.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Representation of Orixá
					Oyá/Yanŝa - Deiti of the winds and storms in Candomblé.</p>

					<p>As I mention in a previous post, Capoeira is loosly
					connected to Candomblé. This can be seen in some capoeira
					musics, as well as in capoeira history. When slaves were
					brought to Brazil in the XVI century and later, they brought
					their religion.</p>

					<p>Candomblé is a mix of three african religions and Orixás were humans who were
					deitifed by Oludumaré, the supreme ruler. Candomblé does not distinguish good
					and evil but rather that we should fully fulfil our destiny while we are alive,
					being aware that any evil we throw out, we receive it back.</p>

					<p>Candomblé practitioners believe they have their own Orixá guiding and
					protecting them in their life, and that their personalities are strongly linked
					to their protector Orixá.</p>

					<p>Oyá, Orixá of the Winds and Storms, is a fearless warrior and a hopeless
					romantic.</p>

				<h3>18 | Trap</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-18.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira has a term called "Malícia". It is commonly
					known as the cunningness or trickery one uses in their game,
					but this cunningness can be demonstrated in different ways.
					</p>
					<p>Depending on the type of game you are playing, you might
					be testing each other out to "trap" the other player.
					Sometimes, once a player is unable to move, the game is
					taken as finished. Both players shake hands and the next
					pair enters the "Roda". </p>
					<p>If you want to know more, I started reading <a
					href="http://capoeira-connection.com/.../malicia_paper_english.pdf">this</a> document which I found
					interesting about "malícia":</p>

				<h3>19 | Dizzy</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-19.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira involves a LOT of body rotations, either from a
					single movement of combinations. One movement in particular
					is called "Pião de Mão", where you spin your whole body in
					one hand!</p>

					<p>Makes you wonder how one doesn't get "dizzy" from that kind of things,
					especially if you make multiple spins.</p>

					<p>The main option to avoid getting dizzy is to practice, however there are some
					tricks you can use to balance this out. You can try to maintain a constant speed
					in your movement, keep yourself in one spot or fixing your sight in one
					spot.</p>

					<p>In a Capoeirista's curriculum, is a folkloric dance
					called "Puxada de Rede".</p>

					<p>After slavery was abolished in Brazil, black people could not find their
					place in the workforce. As a solution to this problem, they started dedicating
					their life to fishing and created this folkloric tradition knows as "Puxada de
					Rede".</p>

					<p>Because life was hard and pulling the fishing net from the sea was even
					harder, they put some spice on it. They sang and synchronized to the "atabaque"
					beat, and celebrated after a successful haul.</p>

					<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYIrB2k1FyA">Here</a> is a video of
					this folkloric dance (it's also used as the backgorund music for this inktober's):</p>

					<small>P.S.: This post is not about corals, how to fish, or how they connect to capoeira xD</small>

				<h3>21 | Sleep</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-21.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Sleep is an important aspect of life, especially if you do sports.</p>

					<p>Exercise depletes energy, fluids and breaks down muscle. Keep yourself
					hydrated and eating well is only a part of muscle recovery. Lack of sleep has a
					very high chance to create a state of fatigue, being easily unfocused and thus,
					becoming unable to retain and process information properly.</p>

					<p>And because the illustration demands it, here are some cuddling benefits:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Increases bonding</li>
						<li>Improves immune system</li>
						<li>Lowers blood pressure</li>
						<li>Relieves stress and anxiety</li>
					</ul>

					<small>note: Cuddling/hugging/massaging doesn't have to be limited to significant
					others, so cuddle away!</small>

				<h3>22 | Chef</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-22.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira games between people need time to develop, like
					food takes time to cook. During the game, the players
					discover each other and themselves, and learn to play
					together. The result can be a heart warming meal at the end
					of the day. </p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>23 | Rip</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-23.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>

					<p>Thanks to Mestre Bimba's efforts, Capoeira became legal,
					but at the time it was still far from being what it is
					today. Seeing a razorblade or "navalha" in a roda or a
					street fight was unfortunately not a rare sight. </p>

					<p>"Cordas" were not the first ranking system in capoeira.
					Instead, capoeiristas used colored silk scarves. This served
					as one of the protective systems against "navalhas". Due to
					the lightness of the material, in case a "navalha" hit the
					silk scarf, the "navalha" would slide through the silk, thus
					protecting the capoeirista from a fatal wound to the
					neck.</p>
				</figcaption>

				<h3>24 | Dig</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-24.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>If you dig through capoeira history, you will come across
					many different components that makes it what it is today. If
					you continue digging through each of those components, you
					will start getting farther away from the surface level of
					capoeira knowledge and start to understand more of its
					essence and particularities.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>25 | Buddy</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-25.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira teaches values of community, non-violence and
					inclusion. It's great for building up friendships!</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>26 | Hiding</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-26.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>One theory as to how Capoeira came to be what it is
					today, is how the slaves danced while guards watched, and
					kicked when they looked away. </p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>27 | Music</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-27.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeirista is not a fighter. He is above all, a
					musician. That's what stays even after you age.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>28 | Float</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-28.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>"Ginga" in capoeira means "Sway" or "Float", because you
					balance yourself from one side to the other. The way you
					float in capoeira, is dependent on how you express yourself
					to the music</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>29 | Shoes</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-29.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>The item that could distinguish between slaves and
					non-slaves were shoes.</p>
					<p>During the slavery period in Brazil, not all black people
					were slaves. Few were able to achieve their rightful freedom
					from their Masters.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>30 | Omnious</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-30.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>In capoeira history, and in a few parts of the world where
					poverty and criminality is very present, it was very
					important to look for people reaching into their pockets
					during a roda as it sometimes could mean they had knifes
					inside.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<h3>31 | Crawl</h3>
				<img src="./media/portfolio/inktober2020/inktober2020-31.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					<p>Capoeira does not restrict the way you move and there are
					even games where you can embrace your inner animal!</p>
